Chirpees
=========
Chirpees are small electronic birds. They are used in a space to improve conditions, especially in austere and high buildings.

The idea of these was to emulate a function of nature by using technology, but also to be able to invade public spaces and create a sonic environment similar to the one found in nature. This project was originally based off the LED Throwies, developed by the Graffiti Research Lab.
